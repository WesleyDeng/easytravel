Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture style.
----------------------------------------------------------

Naveen Balani in Developing RESTful Services with CXF:
"REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is neither a technology nor a
standard; it's an architectural style, a set of guidelines for exposing resources over the
web. The REST architecture style is related to a resource, which is a representation
identified by a Uniform Resource Indicator (URI)".

This project is built using the principles of REST architecture so it can be
termed as a Restful web service.
